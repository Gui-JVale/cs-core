# Security

## Principles

**Security is a measure of the system's ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized.**

The simplest approach to characterizing security has three characteristics: _confidentiality_, _integrity_, and _availability_ (CIA):

- _Confidentiality_: This is concerned with hiding and protecting information from unauthorized access.
- _Integrity_: Integrity means that data isn't available for unauthorized manipulation.
- _Availability_: The system should be available for legitimate use.

Other characteristics that complement CIA are:

- _Authentication_: verifying that the identity of a person or a system is legitimate before proceeding with a transaction
- _Non-repudiation_: certifying that if a message has been sent between two parties, the sending party can't deny having sent the message.
- _Authorization_: grants a user privileges to perform a task.

Approaches to achieving security can be characterized as those that resist attacks, react to attacks, or successfully recover from attacks.

## General Scenario

- _Source of stimulus_: The source of an attack. This can be a person or a system.
- _Stimulus_: An attack on the system that has a goal to deprive the system of one or more of the CIA characteristics
- _Artifact_: The portion of the system under attack. This could be the services of the system, it's data, or data consumed by the system.
- _Environment_: The system is either online or offline, connected or unconnected to a network, sitting behind a firewall or not, fully operational, partially operational, or not operational.
- _Response_: The system ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access; it authenticates all parties of a transaction; data and services aren't manipulated without authorization; parties of the transaction cannot repudiate their involvement; and the data, resources, and system services will be available for legitimate use
- _Response Measure_: This can be the number of attacks the system resisted, the time it took for the system to recover from an attack, the percentage of the system that became unavailable due to an attack, how much time passed before an attack was detected, how much data was vulnerable to a particular attack.

## Tactics

Security tactics are divided into four categories: dtect, resist, react, and recover.

### Detect Attacks

The detect attacks category consists of four tactics: detect intrusion, detect service denial, verify message integrity, and detect message delay.

- **Detect intrusion** is the comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database. The signatures can be based on protocol, TCP flags, payload sizes, applications, source or destination address, or port number.
- **Detect service denial** is the comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-ofservice attacks.
- **Verify message integrity**. This tactic employs techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. A checksum is a validation mechanism wherein the system maintains redundant information for configuration files and messages, and uses this redundant information to verify the configuration file or message when it is used. A hash value is a unique string generated by a hashing function whose input could be configuration files or messages. Even a slight change in the original files or messages results in a significant change in the hash value.
- **Detect message delay** is intended to detect potential man-in-the-middle attacks, where a malicious party is intercepting (and possibly modifying) messages. By checking the time that it takes to deliver a message, it is possible to detect suspicious timing behavior, where the time it takes to deliver a message is highly variable.

### Resist Attacks

There are a number of well-known means of resisting an attack:

- **Identify actors**. Identifying “actors” is really about identifying the source of any external input to the system. Users are typically identified through user IDs. Other systems may be “identified” through access codes, IP addresses, protocols, ports, and so on.
- **Authenticate actors**. Authentication means ensuring that an actor (a user or a remote computer) is actually who or what it purports to be. Passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification provide a means for authentication.
- **Authorize actors**. Authorization means ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or services. This mechanism is usually enabled by providing some access control mechanisms within a system. Access control can be by an actor or by an actor class. Classes of actors can be defined by actor groups, by actor roles, or by lists of individuals.
- **Limit access**. Limiting access involves controlling what and who may access which parts of a system. This may include limiting access to resources such as processors, memory, and network connections, which may be achieved by using process management, memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol. For example, a firewall is a single point of access to an organization’s intranet. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a subnet between the Internet and an intranet, protected by two firewalls: one facing the Internet and the other the intranet. A DMZ is used when an organization wants to let external users access services that should be publicly available outside the intranet. This way the number of open ports in the internal firewall can be minimized. This tactic also limits access for actors (by identifying, authenticating, and authorizing them).
- **Limit exposure**. Limiting exposure refers to ultimately and indirectly reducing the probability of a successful attack, or restricting the amount of potential damage. This can be achieved by concealing facts about a system to be protected (“security by obscurity”) or by dividing and distributing critical resources so that the exploitation of a single weakness cannot fully compromise any resource (“don’t put all your eggs in one basket”). For example, a design decision to hide how many entry points a system has is a way of limiting exposure. A decision to distribute servers amongst several geographically dispersed data centers is also a way of limiting exposure.
- **Encrypt data**. Data should be protected from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is usually achieved by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication. Encryption provides extra protection to persistently maintained data beyond that available from authorization. Communication links, on the other hand, may not have authorization controls. In such cases, encryption is the only protection for passing data over publicly accessible communication links. The link can be implemented by a virtual private network (VPN) or by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for a web-based link. Encryption can be symmetric (both parties use the same key) or asymmetric (public and private keys).
- **Separate entities**. Separating different entities within the system can be done through physical separation on different servers that are attached to different networks; the use of virtual machines (see Chapter 26 for a discussion of virtual machines); or an “air gap,” that is, by having no connection between different portions of a system. Finally, sensitive data is frequently separated from nonsensitive data to reduce the attack possibilities from those who have access to nonsensitive data.
- **Change default settings**. Many systems have default settings assigned when the system is delivered. Forcing the user to change those settings will prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through settings that
  are, generally, publicly available.

### React to Attacks

Several tactics are intended to respond to a potential attack:

- **Revoke access**. If the system or a system administrator believes that an attack is underway, then access can be severely limited to sensitive resources, even for normally legitimate users and uses. For example, if your desktop has been compromised by a virus, your access to certain resources may be limited until the virus is removed from your system.
- **Lock computer**. Repeated failed login attempts may indicate a potential attack. Many systems limit access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer. Legitimate users may make mistakes in attempting to log in. Therefore, the limited access may only be for a certain time period.
- **Inform actors**. Ongoing attacks may require action by operators, other personnel, or cooperating systems. Such personnel or systems—the set of relevant actors—must be notified when the system has detected an attack.

### Recover from Attacks

Once a system has detected and attempted to resist an attack, it needs to recover.Part of recovery is restoration of services. For example, additional servers or network connections may be kept in reserve for such a purpose. Since a successful attack can be considered a kind of failure, the set of [availability tactics](./availability.md#tactics) that deal with recovering from a failure can be brought to bear for this aspect of security as well.

In addition to the availability tactics that permit restoration of services, we need to maintain an audit trail. We audit—that is, keep a record of user and system actions and their effects—to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an attacker. We may analyze audit trails to attempt to prosecute attackers, or to create better defenses in the future.

Ensure also that mechanisms exist for monitoring and recognizing unexpectedly high demands for resources or services as well as mechanisms for restricting or terminating the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Data Model                     | Determine the sensitivity of different data fields. For each data abstraction: <ul> <li> Ensure that data of different sensitivity is separated. </li> <li> Ensure that data of different sensitivity has different access</li> rights and that access rights are checked prior to access. <li> Ensure that access to sensitive data is logged and that the log file is suitably protected. </li> <li> Ensure that data is suitably encrypted and that keys are separated from the encrypted data. </li> <li> Ensure that data can be restored if it is inappropriately modified.</li> </ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Mapping among Architectural    | Elements Determine how alternative mappings of architectural elements that are under consideration may change how an individual or system may read, write, or modify data; access system services or resources; or reduce availability to system services or resources. Determine how alternative mappings may affect the recording of access to data, services or resources and the recognition of unexpectedly high demands for resources. <br/>For each such mapping, ensure that there are responsibilities to do the following: <ul> <li> Identify an actor </li> <li> Authenticate an actor </li> <li> Authorize actors </li> <li> Grant or deny access to data or services </li> <li> Record attempts to access or modify data or services </li> <li> Encrypt data </li> <li> Recognize reduced availability for resources or services, inform appropriate personnel, and restrict access </li> <li> Recover from an attack</li> </ul>                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Resource Management            | Determine the system resources required to identify and monitor a system or an individual who is internal or external, authorized or not authorized, with access to specific resources or all resources. Determine the resources required to authenticate the actor, grant or deny access to data or resources, notify appropriate entities (people or systems), record attempts to access data or resources, encrypt data, recognize inexplicably high demand for resources, inform users or systems, and restrict access. For these resources consider whether an external entity can access a critical resource or exhaust a critical resource; how to monitor the resource; how to manage resource utilization; how to log resource utilization; and ensure that there are sufficient resources to perform the necessary security operations. <br/>Ensure that a contaminated element can be prevented from contaminating other elements. <br/>Ensure that shared resources are not used for passing sensitive data from an actor with access rights to that data to an actor without access rights to that data. |
| Binding Time                   | Determine cases where an instance of a late-bound component may be untrusted. For such cases ensure that late-bound components can be qualified; that is, if ownership certificates for late-bound components are required, there are appropriate mechanisms to manage and validate them; that access to late-bound data and services can be managed; that access by late-bound components to data and services can be blocked; that mechanisms to record the access, modification, and attempts to access data or services by late-bound components are in place; and that system data is encrypted where the keys are intentionally withheld for late-bound components                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Choice of Technology           | Determine what technologies are available to help user authentication, data access rights, resource protection, and data encryption. <br />Ensure that your chosen technologies support the tactics relevant for your security needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
