# Discovering Requirements

## Introduction

Systems are build to fulfill requirements. That's obvious. However, not all requirements are equal to the eyes of the architect. In fact, most of the functional or specification requirements are of  no use to the architect at all.

**We use the term architectural significant requirements (ASR) to define requirements that have a profound effect on the architecture - that is, without this requirement, the architecture would be fundamentally different**. Often, ASRs come up as quality attribute requirements.

These requirements can be discovered in many ways, from requirement documents, to interviewing stakeholders, to gathering business goals for the system. **Experienced architects identify the important stakeholders of the system early on and interview them to understand their goals**.

It's important to note that the architect shouldn't wait for all the requirements to be finalized to start his work, he must start while the requirements aren't completely defined.

## Gathering ASRs from Requirement Docs

An obvious place to look for ASRs are requirements specifications docs (if they exist at all) and user stories. However, do not get your hopes up. Most of these documents are made of functional requirements that are of no use to the architecture. Requirements specifications documents should document quality attribute requirements, but in practice it's not common that they do.

Even though these documents may not provide that much insight for the architect, with some digging, the architect can find ASRs inside them. Here are things to look for:

## Gathering ASRs From Stakeholders

Another source of ASRs are stakeholders. It's important to identify the most important stakeholders and talked to them from the start. This is the surest way to know their needs and expectations.

The result of this interviews should be a list of architecture drivers and a set of QA scenarios that the stakeholders prioritized.

There are many formal and informal methods of doing this, one way is to conduct a Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW).

## Gathering ASRs from Business Goals

Business goals are the _reason d'êntre_ for building a system. You'll see that business goals frequently lead to ASRs. The system's ability to fulfill it's business goal(s) dictates it's success, and this has a major impact on the architecture.

There are three possible relations between a business goal and the architecure:

1. _Business goals often lead to quality attribute requirements_
2. _Business goals may directly affect the architecture without precipitating any quality attribute at all_
3. _No effect at all_

### Categorization of Business Goals

**Business Goals must be captured explicitly**. This is because they often lead to crucial ASRs that can likely go unnoticed or undetected until it's to far down the road and too expensive to change.

List of standard business goals categories:

1. _Contributing to the growth and continuity of the organization_. How does the system being developed contribute to the growth and continuity of the organization? In one experience using this business goal category, the system being developed was the sole reason for the existence of the organization. If the system was not successful, the organization would cease to exist. Other topics that might come up in this category deal with market share, product lines, and international sales.
2. _Meeting financial objectives_. This category includes revenue generated or saved by the system. The system may be for sale, either in standalone form or by providing a service, in which case it generates revenue. The system may be for use in an internal process, in which case it should make those processes more effective or more efficient. Also in this category is the cost of development, deployment, and operation of the system. But this category can also include financial objectives of individuals: a manager hoping for a raise, for example, or a shareholder expecting a dividend.
3. _Meeting personal objectives_. Individuals have various goals associated with the construction of a system. They may range from “I want to enhance my reputation by the success of this system” to “I want to learn new technologies” to “I want to gain experience with a different portion of the development process than in the past.” In any case, it is possible that technical decisions are influenced by personal objectives.
4. _Meeting responsibility to employees_. In this category, the employees in question are usually those employees involved in development or those involved in operation. Responsibility to employees involved in development might include ensuring that certain types of employees have a role in the development of this system, or it might include providing employees the opportunities to learn new skills. Responsibility to employees involved in operating the system might include safety, workload, or skill considerations.
5. _Meeting responsibility to society_. Some organizations see themselves as being in business to serve society. For these organizations, the system under development is helping them meet those responsibilities. But all organizations must discharge a responsibility to society by obeying relevant laws and regulations. Other topics that might come up under this category are resource usage, “green computing,” ethics, safety, open source issues, security, and privacy.
6. _Meeting responsibility to state_. Government systems, almost by definition, are intended to meet responsibility to a state or country. Other topics that might come up in this category deal with export controls, regulatory conformance, or supporting government initiatives.
7. _Meeting responsibility to shareholders_. There is overlap between this category and the financial objectives category, but additional topics that might come up here are liability protection and certain types of regulatory conformance such as, in the United States, adherence to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
8. _Managing market position_. Topics that might come up in this category are the strategy used to increase or hold market share, various types of intellectual property protection, or the time to market.
9. _Improving business processes_. Although this category partially overlaps with meeting financial objectives, reasons other than cost reduction exist for improving business processes. It may be that improved business processes enable new markets, new products, or better customer support.
10. _Managing the quality and reputation of products_. Topics that might come up in this category include branding, recalls, types of potential users, quality of existing products, and testing support and strategies.
11. _Managing change in environmental factors_. As we said in Chapter 3, the business context for a system might change. This item is intended to encourage the stakeholders to consider what might change in the business goals for a system.

### Expressing Business Goals

How will you write down a business goal that you just learned about? Just as with quality attributes, let's use scenarios templates:

1. _Goal-source_. These are the people or written artifacts providing the goal.
2. _Goal-subject_. These are the stakeholders who own the goal and wish it to be true. Each stakeholder might be an individual or (in the case of a goal that has no one owner and has been assimilated into an organization) the organization itself. If the business goal is, for example, “Maximize dividends for the shareholders,” who is it that cares about that? It is probably not the programmers or the system’s end users (unless they happen to own stock). Goal-subjects can and do belong to different organizations. The developing organization, the customer organizations, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers, standards bodies, regulatory agencies, and organizations responsible for systems with which ours must interact are all potential goal-subjects.
3. _Goal-object_. These are the entities to which the goal applies. “Object” is used in the sense of the object of a verb in a sentence. All goals have goal-objects: we want something to be true about something (or someone) that (or whom) we care about. For example, for goals we would characterize as furthering one’s self-interest, the goal-object can be “myself or my family.” For some goals the goal-object is clearly the development organization, but for some goals the goal-object can be more refined, such as the rank-and-file employees of the organization or the shareholders of the organization. Table 16.3 is a representative cross-section of goal-objects. Goal-objects in the table start small, where the goal-object is a single individual, and incrementally grow until the goal-object is society at large.
4. _Environment_. This is the context for this goal. For example, there are social, legal, competitive, customer, and technological environments. Sometimes the political environment is key; this is as a kind of social factor. Upcoming technology may be a major factor.
5. _Goal_. This is any business goal articulated by the goal-source.
6. _Goal-measure_. This is a testable measurement to determine how one would know if the goal has been achieved. The goal-measure should usually include a time component, stating the time by which the goal should be achieved.
7. _Pedigree and value_. The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it, and the goal’s volatility and value. The value of a goal can be expressed by how much its owner is willing to spend to achieve it or its relative importance compared to other goals. Relative importance may be given by a ranking from 1 (most important) to n (least important), or by assigning each goal a value on a fixed scale such as 1 to 10 or high-medium-low. We combine value and pedigree into one part although it certainly is possible to treat them separately. The important concern is that both are captured.

**For the system being developed, \<goal-subject\> desires that \<goal-object\> achieve \<goal\> in the context of \<environment\> and will be satisfied if \<goal-measure\>**.

#### Capturing Business Goals

As we've seen, capturing business goals is important because it allows us to discover ASRs that wouldn't appear in any other context. A method for capturing business goals is **Pedigreed Attribute eLicitation Model (PALM)**. It's a seven step method usually carried out over a day and a half in a workshop attended by archiects and stakeholders.

## Capturing ASRs in a Utility Tree

After gathering ASRs, it's very important to document them in a way that captures their importance. This document can be used for reference and to justify design decisions down the road.

A way to capture ASRs is to use a utility tree. That's simply a tree that has a root with the word 'utility', meaning the 'goodness' of the system. Then you elaborate the tree with the quality attributes of the system, and under each quality attribute, record a specific refinement (such as data latency or transaction throughput).

After that you can use the two ASRs criteria to define the importance of each QA. This criterias are (1) the impact that this QA has on the architecture, and (2) the business value of it. You can simply use values such as low (L), medium (M), and high (H).
