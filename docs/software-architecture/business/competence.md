# Competence

## Introduction

If software architecture is worth "doing," surely it's worth doing well. There is little information that speaks to the fact that architectures are created by architects working ain organizations, full o actual human beings. Dealing with theses humans is decidedly non-technical. What can be done to help architects, especially architects-in-training be better at this important dimension of their job? And what can be done to help architecture organizations do a better job in fostering their architects to produce their best work?

This section is about the competence of individual architects and the organizations that wish to produce high-quality architects. We defined the architecture competence of an organization as follows:

**The architecture competence of an organization is the ability of that organization to grow, use, and sustain the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively carry out architecture-centric practices at the individual, team, and organizational levels to produce architectures with acceptable cost that lead to systems aligned with the organization's business goals.**

## Competence of Individuals: Duties, Skills, and Knowledge

Architects perform many activities beyond directly producing an architecture. These activities, which we call duties, form the backbone of an individual's architecture competence.

Duties, skills, and knowledge form a triad upon which architecture competence for individual rests. Skills and knowledge support the ability to perform the required duties. Infinitely talented architects are of no use if they cannot perform the duties required of the position.

If you want to improve your individual architectural competence, you should do the following:

1. **Gain experience carrying out the duties.** Apprenticeship is a productive path to achieving experience. Education alone is not enough, because education without on-the-job application merely enhances knowledge.
2. **\*Improve your nontechnical skills.** This dimension of improvement involves taking professional development courses, for example, in leadership or time management.
3. **Master the body of knowledge.** One of the most important things a competent architect must do is master the body of knowledge and remain up to date on it. Taking courses, becoming certified, reading books and journals, visiting websites and portals, reading blogs, attending architecture-oriented conferences, joining professional societies, and meeting with other architects are all useful ways to improve knowledge.

### Duties

This section summarizes a wide variety of an architects's duties. Not every architect in every organization will perform every one of theses duties on every project. But a competent architect should not be surprised to find himself engaged in any of the duties listed here.

### Knowledge

A competent architect has an intimate familiarity with th earchitectural body of knowldge. The software architect should:

- Be comfortable with all branches of software engineering from requriements definition to implementation, development, verification and vailation, and deployment.
- Be familiar with supporting disciplines such as configuration management and project management.
- Understand current design and implementatino tools and technologies.

## Competence of a Software Architecture Organization

Organizations by their practices and structure can help or hinder architects in performing their duties. It makes semse, rherefore, to ask wheteher a particular organization is architecturally competent and to develop instruments whose goal is measure the architectural competence of an organization. We won't go into further details into this, see book for more.
