# P2P

## Overview

Peer to Peer is a protocol for many peers to communicate with each other through the network. The biggest difference here is that, while HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS all rely on the client-server model, with servers being always on, the P2P Architecture doesn't rely on a server, or even a host being always on, many peers share data with each other in a distributed manner, acting as both the server, and client, there's no centralized source of data.

Basically each host has a piece of the puzzle, and they can communicate with their peers to get other pieces of the puzzle, and share their own.

P2P use smart, and complex algorithms for host communication.

An important, and sometimes attractive aspect of P2P is that is self-scalable. As peers join the group, there's more computing power, and more communication possibilities. An obvious drawback is the lack of control over the data or assets/resources, which can make it less attractive to companies.

## Use Cases

With this, you can have things like P2P file distribution, where peers communicate with each other to download files, each peer has one, or many parts of the file, and they keep sharing with each other until all of them have the entire file. This also enables distributed database systems, which can use distributed hash tables to keep records.

Also, in a more recent note, cryptocurrencies heavily rely on the P2P Architecture, their blockchains being basically a distributed database on a big P2P system.
